# SAFE-M-5: Content Sanitization

## Overview
**Mitigation ID**: SAFE-M-5  
**Category**: Input Validation  
**Effectiveness**: Medium  
**Implementation Complexity**: Low-Medium  
**First Published**: 2025-01-03

## Description
Content Sanitization is a rule-based filter applied at *inbound* MCP pipeline emit points — tool-description load and retrieved-memory ingest — to strip hidden content patterns and instruction markers before that content enters the model context. It is the deterministic stage of an M-5 → M-3 escalation pipeline: rule hits with low confidence escalate to M-3 *AI-Powered Content Analysis* for model-based classification. It uses pattern matching and structural analysis against an operator-tunable ruleset, with hard-floor rules (always-block) distinguished from tunable rules (operator-configurable threshold). Each sanitization decision (pass / strip / block) emits a structured event to SAFE-M-12 *Audit Logging* so SAFE-M-11 *Behavioral Monitoring* can baseline filter-firing rates over time.

This mitigation is intentionally a layer in defense-in-depth, not a standalone defense. Pattern-based filtering alone is necessarily incomplete: novel attack patterns evade rule sets until added, and adversaries iterate evasion variants. Pair M-5 with [SAFE-M-1](../SAFE-M-1/README.md) *Architectural Defense - Control/Data Flow Separation* (the ambient architectural control that M-5 runs inside), [SAFE-M-3](../SAFE-M-3/README.md) *AI-Powered Content Analysis* (the second-stage classifier for low-confidence M-5 hits, escalation-gated by an operator-tunable suspicion-score threshold), [SAFE-M-4](../SAFE-M-4/README.md) *Unicode Sanitization and Filtering* (the narrow Unicode-specific specialization run as a deterministic pre-pass), and [SAFE-M-22](../SAFE-M-22/README.md) *Semantic Output Validation* (the symmetric output-side gate; M-22 owns outbound surfaces that are intentionally not part of M-5).

## Mitigates

The mitigation directly addresses the following techniques (curated against the actual citation graph; 4 mislabels and 6 partial-fit citers excluded — see Out of scope):

- [SAFE-T1001](../../techniques/SAFE-T1001/README.md): Tool Poisoning Attack (TPA) — sanitization strips hidden instruction patterns and unusual control characters from tool descriptions before they reach the model context.
- [SAFE-T1102](../../techniques/SAFE-T1102/README.md): Prompt Injection (Multiple Vectors) — pattern matching at retrieved-memory and tool-description ingest points removes the most common injection markers (role-prompt phrasing, instruction-override attempts) before they enter the context.
- [SAFE-T1401](../../techniques/SAFE-T1401/README.md): Line Jumping — content arriving at inbound emit points is filtered before it can be ordered ahead of trusted prompt segments in the context window.
- [SAFE-T2105](../../techniques/SAFE-T2105/README.md): Disinformation Output — sanitizing inbound content (retrieved memory, tool descriptions) reduces the corpus of attacker-controllable inputs that could shape model output toward disinformation. Pair with M-22 for output-side validation.

Four citers reference M-5 with non-matching control concepts and six cite M-5 with matching concept but expect functionality outside M-5's content-sanitization scope. See Out of scope below for the per-citer detail.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Principles

1. **Multi-stage filtering at inbound emit points only** — M-5 emits at *inbound* pipeline points only: tool-description load (pre-context) and retrieved-memory ingest (pre-context). Output-side validation (LLM outputs, tool-call argument schema) is M-22's surface, not M-5's. Each emit point has its own pattern set tuned to that surface.
2. **Defense-in-depth, not standalone defense** — M-5 is a deterministic rule-based filter. Suspicious content that exceeds an operator-tunable suspicion-score threshold escalates to M-3 *AI-Powered Content Analysis* for model-based classification. M-1 is the ambient architectural control providing separation guarantees that M-5 operates within — M-5 does not "escalate to M-1"; M-1 always applies.
3. **Fail-loud-not-silent** — every M-5 sanitization decision (pass / strip / block) emits a structured event to M-12 *Audit Logging* including a `confidence_score` (or per-pattern `match_count`) field so operators can empirically tune the suspicion-score threshold during the burn-in period before enabling enforcement. M-11 *Behavioral Monitoring* baselines the resulting filter-firing-rate stream over time.
4. **Pattern set is operator-tunable with hard-floor distinction** — provide a baseline ruleset but require operators to extend it per their own threat model. Hard-floor patterns (always-block, no operator override) and tunable patterns (operator-configurable threshold, suspicions counted toward escalation) are first-class distinctions in the ruleset schema. Suppression policy follows the same governance pattern as M-11: explicit owner, expiry timestamp (default 30 days, max 90 days), audit event on create and modify, mandatory review cadence.
5. **Regex-engine choice matters** — operator-provided patterns can cause catastrophic backtracking under adversarial input (Regular Expression Denial of Service / ReDoS). Where supported, use a linear-time engine (e.g., RE2) rather than backtracking engines (e.g., PCRE) for operator-defined patterns. If PCRE is required, validate operator-supplied patterns against a backtracking-complexity check before installing them and run a fuzzer against representative adversarial inputs in CI.

```

The two emit points are deliberately limited to inbound surfaces. Tool-call output validation, LLM-output validation, and parameter-schema validation are M-22's territory and intentionally not in scope for M-5. Parameter sanitization (allowlisting, unused-parameter stripping, value sanitization), pre-storage memory-write hygiene, and prompt-path sanitization are also out of scope; see Limitations and Out of scope for the rationale and the partial-fit follow-up cluster.

### Prerequisites

- A pattern ruleset maintained as code (versioned, review-gated changes).
- A regex engine choice — RE2 (linear-time) preferred for operator-defined patterns; if PCRE, add a pre-install backtracking-complexity check and CI fuzzer step.
- A suppression-policy store with owner / expiry / audit guarantees.
- [SAFE-M-12](../SAFE-M-12/README.md) *Audit Logging* deployed (M-5's emit destinations).
- (Recommended) [SAFE-M-3](../SAFE-M-3/README.md) deployed for second-stage escalation; [SAFE-M-1](../SAFE-M-1/README.md) deployed as the ambient architectural control; [SAFE-M-4](../SAFE-M-4/README.md) deployed as a Unicode-specific pre-pass.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Define the pattern set per emit point — separate hard-floor (always-block) from tunable (operator-configurable threshold).
   - Define the suppression-policy schema (owner, expiry, audit-event triggers, review cadence).
   - Define the suspicion-score threshold for M-3 escalation; plan a burn-in period during which the threshold is calibrated against M-12 audit data before enforcement.
   - Choose the regex engine and document the ReDoS-safety strategy.

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Implement the inbound emit-point hooks in the MCP host (tool-description load, retrieved-memory ingest).
   - Implement the pattern matcher with `confidence_score` / `match_count` emission to M-12.
   - Implement the suppression-policy API with audit-event emission.
   - Implement the M-3 escalation hook gated by the suspicion-score threshold.

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Roll out in **shadow-rule mode** first — rules fire to M-12 audit but do not block; collect per-rule firing rates and confidence-score distributions for the burn-in period (~2-4 weeks).
   - Calibrate the suspicion-score threshold empirically from the burn-in audit data.
   - Enable enforcement for hard-floor rules first; tunable rules after calibration.
   - Monitor M-3 escalation queue depth continuously after enforcement; an unexpected surge usually indicates the suspicion-score threshold is too low or a rule mis-tune.

## Benefits
- **Deterministic rule-based filtering** of common injection patterns at inbound emit points — bounded behavior under linear-time engines (RE2); debuggable per-rule.
- **Defense-in-depth complement** to M-1 (architectural separation), M-3 (model-based classification), M-4 (Unicode-specific), and M-22 (output-side validation). Each layer has different cost, coverage, and confidence tradeoffs.
- **Operational signal** — M-5's audit stream feeds M-11 *Behavioral Monitoring* baselining and M-70 anomaly detection. Operators see filter-firing-rate trends, suppression usage, and escalation volume.
- **Operator-tunable** — hard-floor vs tunable distinction lets operators tighten coverage per environment without losing the always-on baseline.

## Limitations
- **Insufficient alone** — pattern-based filtering is necessarily incomplete; novel attack patterns evade rule sets until added. M-5 must be paired with M-1 / M-3 / M-22 for layered defense. This is the primary honest framing the prior version of M-5 already acknowledged and this expansion preserves.
- **False-positive cost** — overly aggressive rules block legitimate content (e.g., a tool description that legitimately discusses prompt-injection mitigations). Suppression governance addresses this but doesn't eliminate it; operators must own the tradeoff.
- **Adversarial-evasion arms race** — attackers learn rule sets and craft evasion variants; baselines drift and need maintenance. Periodic ruleset review is mandatory operational hygiene, not optional.
- **ReDoS risk for operator-extended patterns** — backtracking engines (PCRE-style) can be exploited via crafted input causing exponential matching time. Mitigate via RE2 (linear-time guarantee) or pre-install pattern-complexity validation plus CI fuzzing.
- **Unicode-specific tricks are M-4's territory** — zero-width characters, RTL override, homoglyph substitution. M-5 should delegate, not duplicate. Maintaining Unicode rules in two places creates operational drift.
- **Output sanitization is M-22's territory** — M-5 is inbound-only. Tool-call output validation, LLM-output validation, and parameter-schema validation are M-22's surface.
- **Prompt-path filtering is out of scope** — user-prompt content is not a M-5 emit point. M-5 only fires at the two named inbound emit points (tool-description load and retrieved-memory ingest); prompt-text inspection requires a separate prompt-path sanitization control, which is tracked as a partial-fit follow-up (see Out of scope).
- **Parameter sanitization is not in scope** — argument allowlisting, unused-parameter stripping, and parameter-value validation belong to a parameter-validation control (likely a new mitigation; see Out of scope).
- **Memory-write/storage sanitization is not in scope** — M-5 covers retrieval-time, not write-time. Pre-storage hygiene belongs to a storage-side control (likely a new mitigation; see Out of scope).
- **Pattern-policy version skew across MCP host instances** will silently degrade coverage; alarm on it via M-12.

## Out of scope

Ten of the 14 techniques that cite SAFE-M-5 are excluded from the curated Mitigates list above. Four are mislabels (cite M-5 with non-matching control concepts); six are partial-fit (cite M-5 with matching concept but expect functionality outside M-5's content-sanitization scope). Each is tracked for follow-up rather than papered over.

### Mislabel cluster (4 citers — cite M-5 but want different controls)

These citations name M-5 but the actual ask is for a different canonical mitigation. Tracked for redirect-in-followup; redirect targets to be chosen per-case after reading each technique's mitigation-section context.

- `techniques/SAFE-T1202/README.md` cites M-5 as **"Secure Token Storage"** — wants token-storage controls (likely M-31 *Proof of Possession Tokens* or M-37 *Token Rotation and Invalidation*).
- `techniques/SAFE-T1704/README.md` cites M-5 as **"Context Boundary Isolation"** — wants isolation/boundary controls (likely M-1 *Architectural Defense - Control/Data Flow Separation* or M-29 *Explicit Privilege Boundaries*).
- `techniques/SAFE-T1910/README.md` cites M-5 as "Content Sanitization" but the body asks for **strict JSON schemas, regex over allowed character sets, and length limits on tool-call inputs** — i.e., parameter / argument schema validation. M-5 is content-pattern sanitization at inbound emit points, not per-call schema enforcement; the surface is wrong and the control concept (schema validation) is different. Same corpus-side gap as T1302/T1911 below — redirect candidate is the same proposed new "Parameter Validation" canonical mitigation.
- `techniques/SAFE-T2103/README.md` cites M-5 as **"Least-Privilege Agents"** — wants privilege-boundary controls (likely M-29 *Explicit Privilege Boundaries*).

### Partial-fit cluster (6 citers — cite M-5 with matching concept, but the primary ask falls outside M-5's scope)

These citations correctly invoke M-5 as one of several mitigations, but each technique's primary defensive ask requires a control M-5 does not provide. The corpus likely needs new mitigations for these surfaces; a small subset may plausibly redirect to existing canonical mitigations as noted.

- **`techniques/SAFE-T1302/README.md`** ("High-Privilege Tool Misuse") expects **argument allowlisting + shell-metacharacter rejection on tool parameters**. M-5 does not validate parameters. Redirect candidate: **likely a new "Parameter Validation" mitigation** — M-22 *Semantic Output Validation* covers schema validation in a related sense but does not address shell-metacharacter rejection specifically; the corpus does not currently have a parameter-validation mitigation.
- **`techniques/SAFE-T1604/README.md`** ("Multi-Modal Cross-Channel Injection" — cites M-5 in its preventive controls list) expects **filtering of *outbound* error responses to suppress stack-trace and version disclosure**. M-5 is inbound-only (tool-description load + retrieved-memory ingest); outbound error-response filtering is M-22's territory or, more precisely, an output-side error-redaction control adjacent to M-22's surface. Redirect candidate: **M-22 *Semantic Output Validation*** if extended to cover error-response redaction; otherwise a narrower output-side error-sanitization mitigation.
- **`techniques/SAFE-T1702/README.md`** ("Memory Retrieval Abuse") expects **pre-storage memory-write sanitization**. M-5 covers retrieval-time only. Redirect candidate: **likely a new "Memory-Write Hygiene" mitigation** — M-22 does not cover storage-side; no existing canonical maps cleanly.
- **`techniques/SAFE-T1705/README.md`** ("Cross-Server Tool Description Conflict" — cites M-5 to "filter agent communication content for injection patterns and suspicious instructions") expects **inter-agent message filtering**. M-5's two documented inbound emit points are tool-description load and retrieved-memory ingest; agent-to-agent communication content is neither and would require either a third emit point or a separate inter-agent-message-filtering mitigation. Concept matches; surface is undocumented in M-5. Redirect candidate: **a new agent-communication-filtering mitigation OR an extension of M-5 to add an `agent_communication` emit point** — corpus-design conversation needed before deciding.
- **`techniques/SAFE-T1801/README.md`** ("Tool/Resource Exfiltration via Indirect Prompt Injection") expects **prompt-path sanitization against script-like instructions in user prompts**. M-5 has no prompt-path emit point. Redirect candidate: **plausibly M-22 if M-22 is extended to cover inbound prompt validation**, otherwise a new "Prompt-Path Sanitization" mitigation. Of the original four partial-fits, this is the only one that *might* redirect cleanly to an existing canonical mitigation rather than requiring new authoring.
- **`techniques/SAFE-T1911/README.md`** ("Parameter Exfiltration") expects **unused-parameter stripping + parameter-value sanitization**. Same gap as T1302 — M-5 does not validate parameters. Redirect candidate: **same new "Parameter Validation" mitigation** as T1302.

Each cluster is tracked as a follow-up audit task. The mislabel cluster needs per-citer redirect-target decisions (verified against the canonical mitigation set per case). The partial-fit cluster also signals a corpus-side gap: the canonical mitigation set may need new entries for parameter validation, memory-write hygiene, prompt-path sanitization, and possibly agent-communication filtering and an output-side error-sanitization mitigation. Both follow-ups are out of scope for this PR.

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Multi-stage Python sanitizer with M-12 audit emission

This implementation is paired with the ruleset schema in Example 2 — it honors `applies_to`, the per-rule `weight` field, and the `weighted_sum` aggregator described there.

def _hash(s: str) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest()
```

The `confidence_score` and `match_count` fields in every audit event let operators baseline the suspicion-score threshold empirically during the burn-in period before enabling enforcement. The `STRIP` decision branch is reserved for the case where M-3 classifies a M-5 hit as "suspicious but legitimate" — content with injection-pattern features that the model classifier judges non-adversarial; M-5 then removes the matched substrings rather than blocking the whole content.

### Example 3: M-3 escalation hook with configurable suspicion-score threshold

```python
def m3_escalation_hook(content: str, context: str, threshold: float) -> "M3Result":
    """When M-5 produces a low-confidence hit (multiple weak matches but no
    hard-floor), defer the final block/pass decision to M-3's ML classifier.

    The threshold is operator-tunable. Setting it too low (e.g., 0.2) will
    flood M-3's queue with noise and degrade its latency for genuinely
    suspicious cases; setting it too high (e.g., 0.9) loses defense-in-depth
    benefit. Calibrate empirically against M-12 audit data during burn-in.

    Production guidance: monitor M-3 escalation queue depth and the
    M-5-fired/M-3-confirmed rate. If queue depth grows unboundedly, the
    threshold needs tightening; if M-3 rejects most M-5 escalations, the
    threshold may be too aggressive and is wasting M-3 cycles."""
    return m3_classifier.classify(content=content, context=context)
```

## Testing and Validation

1. **Security Testing**:
   - Replay a known prompt-injection corpus (e.g., the AgentDojo evaluation set) at the sanitizer's input; verify hard-floor patterns fire deterministically.
   - Replay corpus variants with adversarial encoding (Unicode tricks, leet substitution, character spacing) to measure false-negative rate; cross-check with M-4's Unicode pre-pass coverage.
   - Replay legitimate content with prompt-injection-related text (e.g., a tool description for a security-research tool) to measure false-positive rate.
   - Replay ReDoS-suspect patterns (catastrophic-backtracking inputs against operator-defined patterns) to confirm engine handles them in bounded time.

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Sanitization latency per emit point under realistic load.
   - M-12 audit event correctness — every decision produces an event with `confidence_score`, `match_count`, `matched_pattern_ids`, and the standard correlation fields.
   - Suppression-expiry workflow — confirm expired suppressions auto-deactivate and reactivation requires owner approval with fresh audit event.

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - M-5 escalation → M-3 classification handoff under varying suspicion-score thresholds.
   - M-5 audit → M-11 baselining alarm on filter-firing-rate spike (synthetic spike injected; alarm latency measured).
   - Suppression-policy version skew alarm — deploy two M-5 instances with different policy versions, verify the skew alarm fires.

## Deployment Considerations

### Resource Requirements
- Pattern-matching adds CPU per emit point; precise overhead depends on ruleset size and regex engine choice. Measure under expected load.
- Ruleset memory scales with rule count; suppression-policy store scales with active suppression count plus audit-event retention.

### Performance Impact
- Latency overhead per emit point depends on ruleset depth and regex engine choice. RE2-style linear-time engines bound the worst case; PCRE-style backtracking engines may degrade unpredictably under adversarial input. No specific timing claim without measurement against your workload.
- M-3 escalation adds latency for low-confidence hits — calibrate the suspicion-score threshold so escalation is reserved for the genuinely-suspicious tail.

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Alarm on (a) sudden drop in rule-firing rate (possible upstream issue or sanitizer bypass), (b) sudden spike (possible attack or rule mis-tune), (c) suppression-policy version skew across hosts, (d) M-3 escalation-queue depth growth (suspicion-score threshold likely too low), (e) M-3-confirmed-malicious rate vs M-5-escalated rate (calibrate the suspicion-score threshold against this ratio).
- *Operational note*: the pattern ruleset is a high-value config. Version it as code; gate updates with M-69 *Out-of-Band Authorization* if the ruleset controls high-risk paths.

## Current Status (2026)

General input-validation guidance is well-established ([OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html), [NIST SP 800-53 SI-10 (Information Input Validation)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)). LLM-specific prompt-injection guidance recognizes pattern filtering as a layer in defense-in-depth, not a standalone defense ([OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications, LLM01: Prompt Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/)).

| 0.2 | 2025-01-09 | Generalized from tool descriptions to all MCP content | Frederick Kautz |
| 1.0 | 2026-05-02 | Expanded stub to template parity per corpus mitigation quality audit; authored Technical Implementation (5 Core Principles including ReDoS engine-choice guidance), Architecture diagram with inbound-only emit points, Prerequisites, Implementation Steps with shadow-rule burn-in and suspicion-score calibration, Benefits, Limitations (with explicit "insufficient alone" honesty plus scope-boundary statements for output / parameters / memory-write / prompts), Implementation Examples (multi-stage Python sanitizer with M-12 confidence_score emission, pattern-ruleset YAML schema with operator-tunable + suppression governance, M-3 escalation hook with configurable threshold), Testing and Validation including ReDoS-suspect input replay, Deployment Considerations, Current Status (source-backed only); curated Mitigates list to 7 directly-mapped citers with technique-specific rationale (4 partial-fit citers and 3 mislabel citers excluded with reason notes — tracked as safe-m-5-partial-fit-cluster and safe-m-5-mislabel-cluster follow-ups); corrected NIST SP 800-53 reference to SI-10 (Information Input Validation); expanded Related Mitigations to include M-1 (ambient architectural control — not escalation target), M-12 (audit substrate), M-22 (output-side complement — non-overlapping); kept M-3 and M-4 with sharper boundary descriptions | bishnu bista |
| 1.1 | 2026-05-04 | Corrected three Mitigates entries that did not match the citing technique's actual ask: T1604 (cites M-5 to "filter error responses" — outbound error-response filtering, but M-5 is inbound-only) moved to partial-fit cluster; T1705 (cites M-5 to "filter agent communication content" — agent-communication is not one of M-5's two documented inbound emit points) moved to partial-fit cluster; T1910 (cites M-5 for "JSON schema enforcement, character-set regex, length limits" — that is parameter / argument schema validation, not content-pattern sanitization) moved to mislabel cluster as the same parameter-validation gap surfaced by T1302/T1911. Curated Mitigates list shrinks 7 → 4 (T1001, T1102, T1401, T2105 retained); Out of scope grows 7 → 10 (4 mislabels + 6 partial-fits). Replaced an in-text reference to an external skill-harness tracking file (which does not exist in the safe-mcp repository and was a dangling pointer for upstream readers) with prose that names the follow-up clusters without claiming an in-repo file. Surfaces new corpus-side candidate mitigations (an output-side error-sanitization mitigation for T1604; an agent-communication-filtering mitigation for T1705) in addition to the v1.0-known parameter-validation, memory-write-hygiene, and prompt-path-sanitization gaps. | bishnu bista |
